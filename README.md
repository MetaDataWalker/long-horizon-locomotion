EmbodiedLab: Long-Horizon Egocentric Locomotion Dataset

TL;DR

Single-person, fully documented expedition — complete traceability, auditable provenance ✅
Event-driven capture — only meaningful terrain/environmental/subjective physiological changes recorded 🌄
Raw forward-facing, silent, uncompressed FHD video — no in-camera optimizers, no digital stabilization 🎥
Consistent core metadata from day one to end-of-expedition, with augmentation when terrain dictates (e.g., arid deserts, urban sprawl) 📍
Field-generated MD5 hashes connect every file to its exact point of capture, ensuring integrity from phone → cloud → desktop ✅
Subtle analogues to extreme planetary terrain conditions for specialized research contexts 🌑
Dataset Overview
This dataset captures a continuous expeditionary walk through Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, focusing on arid deserts, rocky passes, and urban environments. Designed for high-fidelity, traceable egocentric locomotion data, the dataset supports long-horizon modeling while preserving legal compliance and single-source provenance.
Optimized for:
Egocentric perception & navigation
Long-horizon trajectory modeling
SLAM & visual localization
Robotics terrain traversal & planning
Human locomotion & fatigue modeling

Capture Paradigm
Event-driven triggers include:
Terrain geometry transitions: flat → incline → decline, curvature changes
Surface changes: paved, dirt, sand, rocky, loose aggregate
Environmental shifts: weather, heat, wind, visibility
Physiological changes: fatigue, gait adaptation (subjective only)
Infrastructure encounters: settlements, bridges, man-made obstacles
All extreme terrain segments, including arid deserts and dense urban zones, are augmented in the metadata to preserve analytical fidelity. Vehicle-assisted or hitchhiked stretches are explicitly documented for transparency.

Camera & Data Modality
Single forward-facing camera, no audio
Raw FHD capture: optimizers, HDR, and in-camera stabilization disabled
Consistent egocentric viewpoint for the entire expedition
Metadata structure unchanging, with selective augmentation based on terrain or environmental context
Pure visual input optimized for vision-based AI, robotics, and trajectory modeling

GPS Anchoring & Metadata
Start/end-of-day GPS anchors + per-segment metadata
Metadata includes: terrain type, surface, environmental conditions, subjective physiological indicators, segment timing
Supports trajectory reconstruction, mapping, and SLAM evaluation
Maintained separately to preserve visual data integrity

Data Integrity & Provenance ✅
Chain of Custody: Every segment tracked from capture → local storage → cloud → distribution, with logs of handling and timestamps
Hash Verification: Field-generated MD5 hashes provide an unbroken link from original capture to cloud/desktop storage
Segment Integrity Checks: Ensures completeness, playability, and metadata alignment
Fully auditable and legally compliant; single-person source simplifies licensing and traceability
[Insert paragraph here: optional note about how prospective users/researchers can verify integrity themselves]
Single-Person, Single-Source Advantages
